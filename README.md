# Shortcut Keys

## Rules while using Shortcut Keys
1. The Order should be from Left to Right
2. For using `Win + d`, you have to make sure that at first you press `Win` then by holding the key, you then press `d` once and it is done similarly for other shortcuts
3. Remember that the more you use shortcut keys then you will remember it fast
4. Uppercase and Lowercase doesn't matter while using shortcut keys
